Hi <USERNAME>!

I'm the author of Substance.io (that you signed up for in the early days) and I'm reaching out to you because I've got some news to tell.

Over the last two years, Substance has grown into a large project and has gained a lot of attention. People have been contacting us expressing their wish to integrate Substance in their application use-cases. But sadly we have not yet reached a stage in which they could start using it. We'd love to change that!

This is why we started a campaign on Pledgie.com complete with a roadmap clearly describing our goals.

With the help of your donation we could do it, which is exciting! Remember, Substance.io counts 4900 registered users yet. If everyone would donate 10EUR, we were there already. 

Please spread the word for us!

Thanks, and have a great new year!

Team Substance (Michael, Victor, Oliver)
