# Roadmap

Substance 0.5.0 is a full rewrite of Substance, using a completely new distributed architecture.

We've got a tough roadmap to get a first working prototype out, with basic functionality.


## Stage 1

Get individual components ready.

### Substance Composer (Michael)

Implement basic document editor, supporting Section and Text nodes. Basic support and UI for user defined annotations / comments / patches. The Composer should be kept generic

### Substance Surface (Victor)

Get ready a working version of our very own Surface.

### Substance Text (Victor)

Using the Surface, we have an interface (no UI) for custom annotations (e.g. em, strong, link or comments)

### Substance Library



### Substance - The App (Michael)

The mother ship, a reference implementation packages the whole Substance stack, we'll keep this very basic, borrowing stuff from the existing Substance implementation.


## Stage 2 - Put it together

I


## Stage 3 - Build out application specific bits (with ez-XBRL)
