# Prose 0.2.0

We launched Prose.io two weeks ago. The feedback was incredible and so we started implementing some features that were highly requested along with a number of bugfixes.

# Support for Organizations

Heyazaz.


# User Profiles



# Syntax Highlighting

Because it was easy to do, we now support syntax highling for a range of programming languages. Be aware that code editing is not the primary usecase of Prose but it totally fine to use it for quickfixes.

# Bugfixes and smaller improvements

- We now use the same URL scheme as Github, allowing routes for edit and preview of files
- Loading indicator for posts
- Fixed a problem with UTF-8 characters
- Handle binary files (they are previewed by default (e.g. if an image)
