# Prose 0.2.0

It's been two weeks since we launched [Prose](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/june/25/prose-a-content-editor-for-github/)Prose, a content editor for GitHub. The feedback was incredible and so we started implementing some features that were highly requested. This release of Prose adds support for organizations, user profiles and syntax highlighting, and fixes a number of issues that have been identified.

# Support for Organizations

Organizations are accessible from the startpage. Clicking 
Prose 0.2.0 adds support for organizations. You can access them directly on the dashboard.


# User Profiles

Just like with Github 


# Syntax Highlighting

Although Prose is primarily an editor for Markdown files, many users found it to be useful for editing source code files as well. We've added syntax highling for a range of programming languages 

# Bugfixes and smaller improvements

- Upgraded CodeMirror
- We now use the same URL scheme as Github, allowing routes for edit and preview of files
- Loading indicator for posts
- Fixed a problem with UTF-8 characters
- Handle binary files (they are previewed by default (e.g. if an image)
