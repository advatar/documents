[Prose](http://prose.io) is not only suitable for managing website contents. You can use it as a full-featured writing environment too. It gives you a distraction free writing experience, with a focus on content and structure. Also you can share your work at any time or invite other people to collaborate on your document.


### Create a new Github Repository

Make sure there's at least one branch available. The easiest way to do it, is initializing a new Github Repository.

### Start writing

Click on "New File" enter text in markdown. And hit save.

## Remember every change

Only changes are stored on every save. You can access older versions of your document using Github. In future we'll allow you to do that right within Prose.

### Invite collaborators

If your co-workers haven't created a Github Account yet. Now they have a new reason. Permissions are totally transparent to Github. So what you need to do is 
Let others collaborate.

### Share your work

Make sure your repository is public and just share the URL of the post. Readers will always see the most up to date version. So if you or some of your collaborators makes a change, it will immediately be visible.


### Turn it into a website

Remember that you always have the option to turn your document repository in a Jekyll website. However before creating a website, you should write some content. :)

### Organize your posts in folders

Add a new folder directly within Prose.

## Properties

- Prose is closely tied to GitHub. We intentionally made the process transparent, and expose git concepts such as branches, folders and files. You can access every file either with Prose or the Github User interface. So you can mix your workflow by editing in your local text editor and use the regular git commit/push workflow along with Prose.


## Future outlook

- Accessing revision history through the interface
- allow assigning permissions to repos (aka invite new writer)
