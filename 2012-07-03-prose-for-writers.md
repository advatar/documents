Prose is not only suitable for managing website contents.

# Collaborative writing

Git and GitHub made collaboration on software projects very easy. With Prose we can leverage the infrastructure for.

Only changes

## Future outlook

- Accessing revision history through the interface



## Hands on

### Create a new Github Repository

Make sure there's at least one branch available. The easiest way to do it, is initializing a new

### Start writing

Click on "New File" enter text in markdown. And hit save.


### Invite collaborators

If your co-workers haven't created a Github Account yet. Now they have a new reason. Permissions are totally transparent to Github. So what you need to do is 
Let others collaborate.

### Share your work

Make sure your repository is public and just share the URL of the post. Readers will always see the most up to date version. So if you or some of your collaborators makes a change, it will immediately be visible.


### Organize your posts in folders

Add a new folder directly within Prose.

Caveats

- Prose is closely tied to GitHub. We intentionally made the process transparent, and expose git concepts such as branches, folders and files. You can access every file either with Prose or the Github User interface. So you can mix your workflow by editing in your local text editor and use the regular git commit/push workflow along with Prose.


Future:

- allow assigning permissions to repos (aka invite new writer)
