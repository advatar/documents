# Eventually consistent

Most things in life are not perfect. Thatâ€™s also true for every piece of text ever written or to be written. Every writer, journalist or scientist can tell you. There will always be room for improvement.

Essentially, there are two ways of approaching that problem:

1. Invest an infinite amount of effort into reviewing before getting a supposedly perfect text out of the door.
2. Publish early coniuously improve content once it's out, ideally with the help of readers.

With the latest release of [Prose.io](http://prose.io) we'd like to propose a workflow that assumes content will be **consistent eventually**. Much like in the spirit of Open Source Development we claim that continuosly improving content in the open leads to better results than applying the best review process.

# Collaboration

Leveraging collaboration is not a very new idea. People have been invited to contribute to published information since a while. Letters to the editor are as old as newspapers. In the digital world people can respond to articles by leaving a comment.

# The need to contribute

You know that feeling, when you read through an online article and an obvious typo is literally jumping into your face. It's disturbing. But it's there. There's nothing you could do about it.

# Applying a change

Once a suggestion, a patch has been submitted, the original author should get notified somehow. 


# The future

In a perect world, you'd be able to read an article, and if you want to add something, you can simply point your cursor to the actual text and submit a patch.
