# Eventually consistent

Most things in life are not perfect. That's also true for your writings. Every writer, journalist or scientist can tell you about it. There will always be room for improvement.

Essentially, there are two ways you can approach this problem:

1. Invest an infinite amount of effort into reviewing before getting a supposedly perfect text out of the door.
2. Publishing early and contiuously improving your content once it's out, ideally with the help of your readers.

With the latest release of [Prose.io](http://prose.io) we'd like to propose a workflow that assumes content will be **eventually consistent**. Much like in the spirit of Open Source Development, we claim that continuously improving content in the open leads to better results than applying the best review process.

Leveraging collaboration is not a very new idea. People have been invited to contribute to published information since a while. Letters to the editor are as old as newspapers. In the digital world people can respond to articles by leaving a comment.

# Human needs to contribute

You know that feeling, when you read through an online article and an obvious typo is literally jumping at your face. It's disturbing. But it's there. There's nothing you can do about it.

# Removing the hurdles

The most essential problem is that it's pretty hard to get involved. If you're lucky you can put with it. What if you could just touch the content, apply your changes and submit them as a patch? By integrating your publishing workflow with Prose, you can put a link next to your article allowing users to make such contributions.

Prose requires you to be authenticated with GitHub first, once that is done you will be able to edit that content and send a patch, which looks like this:

# Applying a change

Once a suggestion, a patch has been submitted, the original author gets notified via GitHub. In order to apply that change he has to review the Pull Request that has been created automatically.
