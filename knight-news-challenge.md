## 2. How will your project make data more useful? [50 words]

- Semantic Editing: Substance focusses on content and suggests structured, content-oriented writing.

- Collaboration: Substance enables open collaboration. Everyone can participate by adding comments and submitting patches.

- Create once, publish everywhere: Documents are exposed as data, ready to be turned into arbitrary output formats (PDF,ePub, ...) or integrated with other applications.

- Extensibility: Additional content types (formulas, maps) can be added by the community.

## 3. How is your project different from what already exists? [30 words]

Substance considers content as data, which allows for interesting things like semantic data analysis. Imagine you can query documents like a database. With Substance you can.

## 4. Why will it work? [100 words]

It works already. It just takes a serious amount of time to make it solid and reliable. Substance at times has ~ 5000 registered users, and 750 watchers on Github.

## 5. Who is working on it? [100 words]

Michael Aufreiter is the original initiator of this project, and working on it since November 2010. He got precious help by a number of contributors [1], all professional developers and designers (~ 6 persons at time). They are ready to invest more time if they're financially covered.

## 7. How would you use News Challenge funds? [50 words]

Substance is intended to be an open source technology stack [1], rather than a product. We realized that it's impossible to create a content composition tool that works across domains (Scientists, Journalists, etc.). By defining a generic extensible architecture, technically versed users will be able to customize their build and in turn contribute to whole platform.

We already proposed a new architecture for Substance, to solve the issues with the current implementation and to turn it into a flexible toolset anyone can use and customize.

Our new take will feature a generic document format including a protocol for document manipulation, realtime synchronization based on Operational Transformation, a scaleable flexible storage and messaging mechanism, as well as a framework for building content composition tools for the browser.


## 8. How would you sustain the project after the funding expires? [50 words]

Substance has been around for 1.5 years now, built and used by passionate open source developers all around the world. We'll continue improving it, making it an open standard for interoperable digital publishing.
