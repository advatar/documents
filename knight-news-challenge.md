## 1. What do you propose to do? [20 words]

## 2. How will your project make data more useful? [50 words]

Everyone can contribute to a document by adding comments, submitting patches. Documents are exposed as data, ready to be analyzed, visualized, turned into arbitrary output formats (PDF,ePub, ...) or integrated with other applications. Additional content types (formulas, maps, etc.) can easily be added by the community.


## 3. How is your project different from what already exists? [30 words]

Substance considers content as data, which allows for interesting things like semantic data analysis or novel visualizations. Imagine you can query documents like a database. With Substance you can.


## 4. Why will it work? [100 words]

Substance already works. It just takes a serious amount of time to make it solid and reliable. Substance at times has ~ 5000 registered users, and 750 watchers on Github.


## 5. Who is working on it? [100 words]

Michael Aufreiter is the original author of this project, and working on it since November 2010. He got precious help by numerous contributors [1], all professional developers or designers (currently ~ 6 people). They are all ready to invest more time if it can be backed financially.

## 6. What part of the project have you already built? [100 words]

There's a reference implementation available at Substance.io. The system is split into several independent components [1,2,3,4] that can be used independently. Even more useful components will eventually become part of the toolset in the future.

## 7. How would you use News Challenge funds? [50 words]

We'll be building an open source technology stack, not a product. We'll be providing a generic extensible architecture [1], involving an extensible document format and protocol [2], realtime synchronization [3], a framework for building content composition tools for the browser [4] as well as a reference implementation [5].

## 8. How would you sustain the project after the funding expires? [50 words]

Substance has been around for 1.5 years now, built and used by passionate open source developers all around the world. There was no funding involved so far. We'll continue improving it, making it an open standard for interoperable digital publishing.
