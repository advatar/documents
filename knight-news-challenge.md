## 2. How will your project make data more useful? [50 words]

- Semantic Editing: Focus on content and structured, content-oriented writing.

- Open Collaboration: Everyone can participate by adding comments and submitting patches.

- Create once, publish everywhere: Documents are exposed as data, ready to be turned into arbitrary output formats (PDF,ePub, ...) or integrated with other applications.

- Extensibility: Additional content types (formulas, maps, etc.) can easily be added by the community.


## 3. How is your project different from what already exists? [30 words]

Substance considers content as data, which allows for interesting things like semantic data analysis. Imagine you can query documents like a database. With Substance you can.


## 4. Why will it work? [100 words]

It works already. It just takes a serious amount of time to make it solid and reliable. Substance at times has ~ 5000 registered users, and 750 watchers on Github.


## 5. Who is working on it? [100 words]

Michael Aufreiter is the original initiator of this project, and working on it since November 2010. He got precious help by numerous of contributors [1], all professional developers and designers (currently ~ 6 active contributors). They are all ready to invest more time if it can be backed financially.

## 7. How would you use News Challenge funds? [50 words]

We'll be building an open source technology stack, not a product.
