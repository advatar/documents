# The Team

In alphabetical order.

## Michael Aufreiter

Michael is committed to the idea of open digital publishing by considering content as data and seperating it from presentation. Back in 2012 he kicked off Substance in order to verify that idea.

Focus on:

- [Overall Architecture](http://interior.substance.io/features/distributed.html)
- [Substance Composer](http://substance.github.com/modules/composer.html) - The document editor
- [Substance Talk](http://substance.github.com/modules/talk.html) - A JSON-based data exchange prototcol

## Oliver Buchtala

Oliver was involved in the design process of both, the original Substance Document Format and [Data.js](http://github.com/michael/data) Substance's graph-oriented data-layer. He's a strong background Mathematics, and dynamic code generation. And he recently supervised a Google Summer of Code project bringing [Javascript to SWIG](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/swig/about.html). Based on his experience we'd be able to combine web-technology (Javascript / CSS) and native components to build out a Substance Application that can either locally on in a hosted environment. Oliver received his Masterâ€™s of Science degree in Computer Science at the university of passau in 2005.


Focus on:

- Native Substance Backend
- Packing Substance as native application
- [Substance Library](http://substance.github.com/modules/library.html)


Projects:

- Gearbox


## Victor Saiz

Victor joined the team this spring. He's been working on the most challenging part, namely web-based content editing. We're moving away from our previous approach using contenteditable (a browser-native interface) to our our very own implementation (Substance Surface) that allows us to build components like Substance Text and the Substance composer, offering arbitrary complex annotations. Victor has a music production background and but is focussed doing web-development for quite some years.
