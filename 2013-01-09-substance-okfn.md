We are creating the Substance platform as a response to the challenges of digital publishing.

## The challenges of digital publishing

### Multiple output formats



### Peer-review processes



# Substance

Substance is built around some core ideas:

### Separate content from presentation

### Structured composition, using different types of content elements

Most often things work best when there are simple rules. This is why Substance cosiders documents a sequence of elements. Thatâ€™s it.

### Beyond markup

Markup languages such as HTML and Markdown are widely used to write and annotate digital documents. However, there

are used to include style information in documents.

### Semantic editing

### Offline editing

You want your texts to be secure when typing.
