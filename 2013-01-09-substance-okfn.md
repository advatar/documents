Markup languages such as HTML and Markdown are widely used to write and annotate digital documents. However, they are hard to handle by non-tech people.


# Substance

Substance is built around some core ideas:

### Content is data

Substance considers content as data, which makes them accessible to computers and allows new ways of processing them. Documents can not only be viewed, they can be queried, just like a database. Please refer to the documentation of the Substance Document module to learn how this works.

### Structured composition, using different types of content elements

Most often things work best when there are simple rules. This is why Substance cosiders documents a sequence of elements. That’s it.

Anyone can create a free account on the Substance.io server and start publishing their content online in one click straight from the Composer. You can think of it as an open document repository from where you will be able to manage your published content, add it to existing networks, find other people’s public documents or export yours in any format imaginable (print, web, tablet, mobile and more).
